point.

`x` and `y` specify the coordinates of the top left corner, and `w` and `h`
specify width and height respectively. 

`type` determines the fader type and orientation. Possible values are:

* 0 - coarse, horizontal bar
* 1 - coarse, vertical bar
* 2 - coarse, horizontal dot
* 3 - coarse, vertical dot
* 4 - fine, horizontal bar
* 5 - fine, vertical bar
* 6 - fine, horizontal dot
* 7 - fine, vertical dot

Coarse faders have the possible range of 0..N-1 where N is width for horizontal
faders or height for vertical faders. Pressing anywhere within the fader area
sets the fader value accordingly. Fine faders allow selecting a bigger range
of values by mapping the range to the fader's height or width and dedicating
the edge buttons for incrementing/decrementing. Fine faders employ
varibrightness to reflect the current value.

`level` has a different meaning for coarse and fine faders. For coarse faders
it selects the background brightness level (similar to buttons). For fine faders
this is the maximum value level (the minimum level being 0). In order to show
each value distinctly using varibright the maximum level possible is the number
of available buttons multiplied by 16 minus 1 (since range is 0-based). Remember
that 2 buttons are always reserved for increment/decrement. Using a larger
number is allowed - it will be automatically adjusted to what's possible. 

`script` specifies the script to be executed when the fader value is changed.
